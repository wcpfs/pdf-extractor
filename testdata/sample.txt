Where on Golarion?
In Service to Lore takes place in the teeming metropolis of
Absalom--the City at the Center of the World. Here the
Pathfinder Society makes its home, and Pathfinders from
all over the world consider Absalom a second home, as
many of their missions take place within the city's walls.
A settlement of over 300,000 souls, Absalom boasts many
districts that are virtually cities unto themselves, and PCs
in this adventure will visit several of them in the course
of their mission. For more information on Absalom and
its various districts, check out Pathfinder Campaign Setting:
Guide to Absalom, available in hobby stores and bookstores
everywhere and online at paizo.com.

· Absalom
A gruff, no-nonsense man, Ambrus has little tolerance
for laziness and often gives young Pathfinders their first
taste of what being a field agent entails as a way of keeping
them from staying idle too long.
Among the various factions allied with the Pathfinder
Society are five powerful nations locked in a shadow war for
control of Absalom--Andoran, Cheliax, Osirion, Qadira,
and Taldor. While the Pathfinder Society has no direct
interest in this political standstill, they nevertheless
have much to gain from allying with these powerful
nations. Though they aren't a recognized political body,
the Varisian swindlers and smugglers known as the
Sczarni provide their own support for the Society, acting
as fences, contacts, or mules when the organization
P
athfinders explore Golarion in service to lore.
This widespread group of treasure hunters, thrill-
seekers, sages, and voyagers make it their lives'
work to uncover lost artifacts, map neglected ruins, and
learn forgotten knowledge. They do these things for the
sake of lore, as well as for fame. The Pathfinder Society
publishes the Pathfinder Chronicles, a multi-volume series
of chapbooks highlighting some of the most amazing
finds by field agents.
Pathfinders are part archaeologist, part historian, and
all adventurer. Many established Pathfinders make their
own way in the world, following their interests or tracking
down leads to greater mysteries. These established few
are still subject to orders from their superiors, but the
least prestigious tasks are usually reserved for those
new to the organization. The Society is governed by the
Decemvirate, 10 anonymous leaders who pull strings
and guide the organization from Skyreach in the Grand
Lodge of Absalom. They hand down orders from their
secret posts to venture-captains, who in turn pass the
orders to field agents.
The Society has few rules, but all Pathfinders are
expected to perform the Three Duties: explore, report,
and cooperate. Idle Pathfinders are useless to the
organization, and agents must seek out secrets or further
their work in exploration of some kind, always growing
and gathering knowledge. This exploration would be
worthless if not for frequent reports. Pathfinders must
send back accounts of their adventures, many of which end
up published by the Decemvirate. Finally, Pathfinders are
great heroes from dozens of countries and backgrounds
with thousands of different motivations and allegiances,
and the Decemvirate expects that individual Pathfinders
will not interfere with one another, and absolutely never
let a conflict between themselves come to blows.
Despite the mandate to cooperate, Pathfinders have
myriad motivations and often fall in with similarly
minded factions within the organization, or external
groups with close ties to the Society. As fresh new recruits,
most Pathfinders know only the venture-captains who
give them their training, especially Ambrus Valsin, the
man in charge of daily operations in the Grand Lodge.

The First Steps Series
The three-part First Steps series is intended to introduce
new players and new characters from experienced players
to the Pathfinder Society, the city of Absalom, and the ten
factions to which all members of the Pathfinder Society
Organized Play campaign belong. While each adventure in
the series is a self-contained story, they are intended to be
played in order by brand-new PCs without any experience
or Prestige Points. At the end of the third scenario, A Vision
of Betrayal, after the PCs have met and done a favor for
all 10 faction heads, they will be able to choose their PCs'
allegiance and gain retroactive prestige for the completion
of the previous two scenarios.
This series may only be played at the normal advancement
rate of 3 XP per level, meaning a PC completing the series will
advance to 2nd level, making the character a bit more sturdy
for tiered adventuring in normal Pathfinder Society play.

needs to get relics or agents in and out of hostile territory
unseen. Within the Society itself, fractured groups such
as the Shadow Lodge, Silver Crusade, and the Lantern
Lodge each work to ensure the organization's resources
are applied where they feel they're most needed, be that
for the betterment of the active field agent, in distant
Tian Xia, or spreading good deeds throughout the Inner
Sea.
A new batch of Pathfinder agents has completed their
training and now stand fresh and wide-eyed before
the towering structure of Skyreach awaiting their first
assignment for the Pathfinder Society. Venture-Captain
Ambrus Valsin has just the task for them, both to keep
them relatively safe in the dangerous world beyond, and
to familiarize them with Absalom, their new home, and
some of the most influential allies of the Society in the
City at the Center of the World.
Summary
Venture-Captain Ambrus Valsin charges the beginner
Pathfinders to complete a list of tasks for the Pathfinder
Society. These small tasks are too simple and menial for
established agents to deal with, but perfect to test the
capabilities of new recruits. After a short speech about
what it takes to be a Pathfinder, Valsin hands the PCs an
envelope containing the tasks and directions to where
they are supposed to find their contacts.
The first task on the list requires the PCs visit a creepy
curio shop owned by Guaril Karela, a Varisian fence who
heads the Sczarni crime syndicate in Absalom. He asks
the group to retrieve a case of books from an "abandoned"
warehouse. While trying to figure out how to safely
retrieve the crate, balanced above a hole in the floor of
the warehouse, dire rats nesting in the building attack
the PCs.
The second task sends the PCs to deliver a parcel of
medicine for the Silver Crusade--a faction of Pathfinders
dedicated to using the Society's resources to do good and
help the downtrodden wherever their journeys take them.
Their leader, the Sarenite paladin Ollysta Zadrian, asks
the PCs to vet the headmistress of the orphanage where
the medicine is to be sent. In fact, Auntie Baltwin is a
cruel old alcoholic, who sells medicinal donations on the
black market, and puts the children to work for additional
profit. The canny old woman doesn't make proving her
wrongdoings easy, and the PCs need keen skills to spot
illicit behavior.
The third task introduces the PCs to Amenopheus, the
Sapphire Sage of Osirion, under the premise of visiting
his liege to obtain permission to delve the ancestral
vaults of a prominent family in Sothis. The sage speaks
in place of the absent noble to whom he serves as advisor,
granting this privilege only after the PCs solve a puzzle in
the estate's vault to prove their mettle.
The fourth task places the PCs in Paracountess Zarta
Dralneen's uncomfortable embrace. The Chelish envoy
borrowed an item from the Grand Lodge, and the PCs
need to retrieve it. The twist: A servant imp snatched the
magical box and the paracountess trapped the enraged
creature in her precious bedroom where the creature
wreaks havoc. The PCs must either defeat or calm the
imp and get the box back to the Grand Lodge.
While the Pathfinders move through the city in pursuit
of their assignments, a group of ruthless adventurers
hoping to earn some easy gear and start making a name
for themselves follows the PCs' every move. Although the
new Pathfinders have a chance to spot these adventurers
throughout the day, the thugs keep a low profile and
ambush the PCs as they head back to the Grand Lodge
after finishing their assignments for the day.
Getting Started
Fresh off their induction into the Society and
the completion of their basic training within the
organization, the PCs find themselves in the office
of Ambrus Valsin, the venture-captain in charge of
daily operations in and around the Grand Lodge. The
efficient and straightforward chamberlain greets the
PCs curtly and motions for them to sit before jumping
straight into their assignment. Read the following to get
the adventure underway.
"All right, Pathfinders! Listen up. I know you are new recruits
eager to make names for yourselves in the organization, but

The cheapest method of getting around is walking, but
PCs may wish to rent transportation if they would rather
relax. Each leg of a journey in a hired coach costs 1 cp, but
a coach can only carry four people comfortably.
Keep in mind the limited time available to
complete the scenario, but feel free to add flavorful
tidbits about the city as the PCs travel through
it. Absalom is the largest city in the Inner
Sea region, and possibly all of Golarion, and
Pathfinders should get the sense that they
can find anything and everything within
its limits.
As the Pathfinders move about
the city, they're shadowed by a
band of thugs, upstart criminals
looking to get a leg up on their
own adventures by mugging a
team of weak Pathfinders who
they suspect have prime equipment
and sizable wealth. During the course of
the adventure, allow the PCs to get a glimpse of one of
these miscreants. Permit each PC a Perception check as
the group moves between encounters. Anyone making a
DC 15 or higher notices one of the thugs watching them
intently from across a crowded street; as a throng of
people moves between the PCs and their observer, the
thug disappears into the crowd. Later in the adventure,
allow each PC a Sense Motive check. Those that make
a DC of 15 or higher get the sense that they're being
watched, but can't pinpoint who or where the sensation
comes from. Make a note of which PCs succeed at either
of these checks, as it will come into play in the final
encounter of the adventure.
Act 1: A Favor For Thieves
The first task on the PCs' list is to visit Guaril Karela, head
of the Absalom-based Sczarni, at his curio shop--The
Pickled Imp--in the seedy, harborside Docks district.
1a. The Pickled Imp
This creepy shop contains myriad odds and ends, most bereft
of any discernible use. A number of malformed creatures and
creature parts bob in jars on a long, prominent shelf, a tiny
fetal devil centered in this macabre lineup. The shopkeeper,
a greasy-haired Varisian with a thin mustache, shouts from
behind the cluttered counter:
"Ah yes, I see the Pathfinders have arrived. I'm glad Ambrus
was able to lend a few of his new recruits to help me. Please
come in and let me tell you what I need."
Looking around as if to be absolutely certain no customers
are browsing the aisles of knock-off Thuvian burial urns or
first we need to make sure you are up to snuff and won't get
yourself killed out there. I have a number of small assignments
for you and your team, and it would be best if you could
finish them before the day's end.
"Every day we get some doe-eyed hopeful or
some sniveling bootlicker willing to do anything
to join up with the Pathfinders. Most of them are
good kids, but not all of them have the salt to
make it in a world like this. It's rough out there
and I'm not just talking about the ruins, tombs,
and wilderness Pathfinders find themselves
in on missions. We've got people who look
down their noses at us, folks who think
we squander our resources, and agents
who want to take everything we have
collected. This wealth of knowledge
and these items of lore make us the
most powerful organization on the
planet. That said, since we are fractured
and widespread, it's difficult for that power
to light on anything for too long. For every friend of the
Society, there are two enemies.
"Your first mission, to test your mettle and loyalties, sends
you to meet a few people important to the Society living here
in Absalom. These are other venture-captains or close allies of
our organization, so follow their orders as you would mine. I've
prepared a list of things I want you to do. They're not arranged
in any particular order of importance, but I want them all
completed as quickly as possible. Only report to me once you
complete them all. Included in the envelope you hold in your
hands is the list, complete with the name of your contact, and
directions to the meeting location."
Allow the PCs to look over the handout outlining their
tasks (see page 21). The group may have questions about
where certain locations are in the city. Since the PCs
have directions to each meeting site, allow the group to
use the layout of the city to prioritize their course for
the day.
Since the PCs begin in Absalom, allow them to purchase
any items they may need before the adventure if they
showed up ill equipped. Venture-Captain Valsin briskly
deflects any questions, instructing the Pathfinders to see
their contacts for more information, reminding the PCs
those contacts are to be treated as authority figures and
be both respected and obeyed.
Out and About in Absalom
The PCs have free reign of Absalom during this scenario,
and can go to the four appointed locations in any order.
The PCs may move about Absalom however they wish,
and should feel free to explore the city as they go from
district to district performing their assigned duties.

supposed Azlanti porcelain, he begins again.
"Well met. I am Guaril Karela. A friend of mine has a
warehouse near here and he received a parcel on behalf of
me and some of my associates, but there's a problem. See,
Master Gelbane had to leave town in a hurry and
our shipment is still waiting at his warehouse.
Rumor is he ended up in trouble with the law
and the place was seized. I heard tell from
someone down at the docks that some creep
was snooping around his warehouse just the
other night, so I want to make sure nothing
of mine was taken. He keeps all kinds of things,
from beer to nails, in that old pelican, but every
now and then he stores something really special.
This is one of those cases.
"There's a big crate marked with three
crows arranged in a triangle. Inside that
crate is a smaller container with a few
books and papers in it. That's the only parcel
I'm interested in, and as far as I'm concerned,
you can help yourself to the rest of the crate.
Honestly, anything else you want in the place
too. I'm sure the once things get sorted out, the city will
seize most everything else anyway.
"My associates and I often work with the Pathfinders when
it comes to special relics and documents, getting them in
and out of ports and across borders where the authorities
ask too many questions. Most people don't realize what they
have and frankly many don't deserve to have it, so sometimes
we help take the goods off their hands. If things work out well
and you get this done, I'd be glad to talk with you more and
help you out with any future endeavors, as long as you help
me out too. I'm good at returning favors, trust me."
Guaril Karela (CN male human rogue 11) is a well-
connected Sczarni who has his hands in as many pots as
Absalom can provide. Based out of such a bustling city,
Karela keeps his eyes on the harbor and what valuable
items cross its docks. While friendly enough if you're
on his good side, this thin Varisian man has a face that
always seems to be sneering, often tilting his mustache
like the animated hands of a clock.
Karela answers any questions the PCs ask with varying
levels of clarity. Regarding the site of the warehouse,
he responds with details of the rickety building and its
entrances. In these answers, feel free to describe the
warehouse to the PCs before they arrive, as Karela is
familiar with the place. If any PCs ask personal questions,
try to identify of his associates, or infer that their task
may not be entirely legal, he responds only with vague
answers. If they press him on these points, he tries to
steer the conversation to other topics or simply ushers
them out the door, encouraging them to get to their task.
If anyone gets too aggressive, he reminds them they are
doing this for Ambrus Valsin and the Pathfinder Society,
speaking strongly about their duty through clenched
teeth with narrowed eyes.
1b. The Pier
Perched on the end of a long pier fifteen feet
above the water, the warehouse appears to
struggle against its own roof, threatening to
sag into the bay below. No light shines from the
building's windows and only the movement of
gulls and pelicans stirs the scene.
Called pelican warehouses, these
buildings perch at the end of piers,
allowing a ship to load and unload
farther out from the busier docks.
Many of them either accommodate
smaller vessels that are in a hurry or
larger ships unable to find an open
dock. Rare these days, most pelican
warehouses lie in disrepair, withered from storms and
salt, and every year it seems another one falls into the
harbor. An increased tax on this type of property keeps
many of the owners from rebuilding and some have
even relinquished the titles to their small warehouses,
allowing them to fall into the hands of squatters and
smugglers--or into the bay itself.
Smugglers sometimes use small boats to slip under
the warehouse, sawing a hole in the floor or prying
boards in the night, and sneaking in to loot the place or
just drop a crate into their boat from above and paddle
away in the night.
The pier this pelican warehouse sits on stretches 100
feet from the boardwalk and the docks proper, and stands
15 feet above the water. The planks on the pier are sturdy
but weathered. A few local fishermen and some kids sit
scattered along the pier casting nets or bobbing lines into
the waters below.
The building looks abandoned and in disrepair. The
windows are dark and dirty and provide no view into the
structure's interior. A small boat bobs in the water below,
tethered to the pier by a stout, salt-crusted rope. The
warehouse's heavy wooden front door is locked (Disable
Device DC 15) and the loading door is barred from the
inside, requiring a DC 22 Strength check to force open. If
they can get in the right position on the small ledge that
runs along the sliding doors, multiple PCs can aid the
Strength check, each adding a +2 to the effort. A hidden
key sits sandwiched between two rickety slats on the
building near the doorframe, discoverable with a DC 25
Perception check.

1c. Saltspray Pelican Warehouse
(CR 1)
Darkness fills the warehouse, the ambient light from outside
blocked by a filthy, oily film on the structure's few windows.
Darting illumination comes from light reflecting off the
water through a splintered hole in the floor. Throughout the
warehouse, crates, boxes, and barrels lean against each other
in vaguely sorted stacks. A lingering smell indicates some of
the contents are certainly spoiled.
Perched in the middle of the hole, teetering on split
planks, sits a large crate stamped with three crows
arranged in a triangle--the very crate the PCs have
come to find. Handholds cut into the stout wooden crate
ring the rim. Other barrels, boxes, and crates sit stacked
along the walls of the warehouse. Just inside the door
sits a handful of crates and kegs of beer. Most of these
smaller crates and barrels contain foodstuffs in various
states of freshness. Some crates reek of rot. Stacks of
simple coffins sit against the east wall. The rest of the
crates stacked along the north and south walls contain
simple sundries including, but not limited to beer,
blocks of clay, coffee, coils of rope, dried fish, lead ingots,
nails, nets, raw cotton, rough wool, spare sails, timber
planks, various pulleys and tools, and cheap weapons.
Some of these materials, while certainly valuable, are
more important to the PCs as tools to help them get
their real prize.
A crane, used for loading and unloading boats, clings
to a rail running the length of the warehouse, hanging 5
feet below the high ceiling, and can slide out to extend
past the loading doors along the west wall. PCs can
use ropes and nets from the warehouse's crates to rig
the crane and snatch up the crate, but a character must
venture out onto the teetering beams to tie the knots and
secure the crate to the harness. In addition to the risks
posed by the squares surrounding the hole (see Hazard,
below), walking out on one of the two beams imposes a
­4 penalty on all related Acrobatics checks and any Reflex
saves resulting from failure.
Creatures: Though the warehouse is supposedly
abandoned, a trio of dire rats has moved in and now nests
along the north wall. While the PCs search the warehouse
and formulate a plan to safely get the crate from above the
hole, the dire rats lie sleeping. Irritated at the intrusion,
they squeeze through the crates and attack the PCs
surrounding the hole.

9
DC 10 Perception check finds anything mentioned above
in the warehouse description, while anything more rare or
valuable than the items listed requires a DC 15 Perception
check and 5 minutes of searching. The warehouse doesn't
contain anything magical or any single item worth more
than 150 gp.
Treasure: The rescued crate holds a smaller mahogany
box inside, which contains five books and a few loose sheets
of paper in a leather folder. The titles and subjects seem
completely unrelated to each other: Practical Thaumaturgy
In Accordance with Creation, Geographic Anomalies of the
Inner Sea, Under Kaer Maga: A Trial and Travel, Physiology of
Dragons: An Illustrated Reference, Lost Sarusan. The leather
folder contains cargo manifestos, warehouse inventories,
and other financial logs from a dozen different merchant
houses and trade guilds.
The crate also contains 10 sets of masterwork thieves'
tools, three flasks of alchemist's fire, a flask of acid, a dozen
jars of various inks, a footprint book*, adamantine weapon
blanch*, three bags of powder*, a deck of marked cards*,
and two sets of average loaded dice*. (Items marked with
an asterisk may be found in the Advanced Player's Guide.)
Rewards: If the PCs bring the books in good condition
to Guaril Karela, give each PC 111 gp.
Act 2: A Crusade Of Light
The second task on the PCs' list is to head to the Temple
of the Shining Star, the Ascendant Court's massive temple
to Sarenrae, to meet with Ollysta Zadrian, a retired
Pathfinder now operating the Silver Crusade, an effort
to use the Society's resources to help those in need and
spread good deeds throughout the world.
2a. Temple of the Shining Star
Arriving at the Temple of the Shining Star, the PCs are
immediately directed to Ollysta Zadrian. This paladin
of Sarenrae is young in her years, but holds herself with
the poise of a queen and warrior simultaneously. As she
notices the PCs' arrival, she strides forward, addressing
the group in a strong voice.
"Thank the light of Sarenrae you have arrived! I knew Ambrus
would come through for us in the Silver Crusade. I desperately
need you to bring medicine to an orphanage and let me know
if the headmistress, Gilga Baltwin, is deserving of our charity.
Since our quest began, the needy have clamored for our aid,
and I suspect some are abusing our generosity. It may sound
cruel, but there are plenty of dishonest people out in the world
eager for easy gold.
"Do you know of the Silver Crusade? After discovering so
many factions splintered the Society, a number of us banded
together to proliferate the cause of charity and kindness using
Dire Rats (3)CR 1/3
hp 5 (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 232)
Tactics
During Combat Hardly tacticians, the dire rats always attack
the nearest PC.
Morale Protective of their den and food, the dire rats fight to
the death.
Hazard: The edges of the hole are dangerous and
anyone stepping into one of the squares around the hole
must make a DC 10 Acrobatics check or risk collapsing
the floor further--and spilling the crate into the water.
In addition, these squares count as difficult terrain
due to their precarious nature. PCs succeeding at a DC
15 Acrobatics check can ignore the difficult terrain and
move through the squares normally. Any result of this
check that fails by 10 or more forces the character to
succeed at a DC 12 Reflex saving throw or fall into the bay
below. Small characters receive an additional +1 bonus on
the Acrobatics check and any resulting Reflex save due
to their lighter weight. The drop into the water along
with the falling debris deals 1d6 points of nonlethal
bludgeoning damage. If the crate falls into the water, the
books and papers are damaged unless the PCs can pull
the crate from the water within 3 rounds. The water here
is 15 feet deep.
Development: While simply walking out and dragging
the crate from its precarious position is next to impossible
for these new adventurers, the group can successfully
achieve their task with materials at hand and a little
creativity. Four likely solutions are listed below, but allow
the players to come up with their own clever solutions to
the problem.
· A PC strong enough to lift the 200-pound crate could be
suspended by the crane and positioned over the crate.
· The PCs can throw a rope with a hook at the handholds
to secure the crate from afar. Treat this as a thrown
weapon with a range increment of 10 feet targeting
AC 10.
· The PCs could also borrow the boat docked outside
and simply collapse the floor, dropping the crate safely
onto the deck of the boat.
· The PCs can use the timber and tools to brace the floor
and slide the crate to firm ground.
If the group cannot seem to come up with a plan,
urge them forward by asking for skill checks. A DC 10
Knowledge (engineering) check gives them a hint to
one of the solutions mentioned above. A general DC 15
Intelligence check reveals the same hint. Searching
through the other crates for tools to help them should
be simple, and once the group has spent a few minutes
looking through the pile of wares, allow them to find any
reasonable item that might help them with their task. A

the Society's resources. As it is said, `The Dawn brings new
light' and I've made it my life's work to use our recent darkness
to bring a new light to the world and to the Pathfinder Society.
I apologize for straying off point. Will you bring this parcel
of medicine to Auntie Baltwin's Home for Recovery in the
Eastgate district?"
Zadrian is eager to answer any questions the PCs may
have about the Silver Crusade, but urges the PCs along if
they linger too long. While talking to them, she says she
isn't sure if Gilga Baltwin is honest or not, but hopes this
delivery by Pathfinder agents will confirm whether the
orphanage is operating on the up and up. She asks the
PCs to be observant and report back to her any evidence
that Baltwin isn't worthy of the Silver Crusade's aid.
Diplomacy (Gather Information) or
Knowledge (Local)
Before the PCs head to Auntie Baltwin's Home for Recovery,
they may wish to ask around about the orphanage and the
headmistress's quality of character. While most witnesses
admit she is a mean old bag, they also all reply they think
it is great what she's doing for the children.
DC 10: Miltivis, who runs a nearby market, claims he's
served Auntie Baltwin for over 30 years, and while a good
customer, she is quite demanding and often rude to the
other customers. He says she's kept his supplier of fine
whiskeys in business for decades.
DC 15: Gilga Baltwin's neighbors Travost and Tirelle
Anthos are frankly tired of the noises the children make
and the retinue of cats--though they do appreciate the
latter's mousing skills. They admit to being happy when
Auntie Baltwin sends the children "off into the town"
during the day, as it gives them a few hours of peace and
quiet before they return in the evening.
DC 20: At the estate across the street, Master Trebb
Bonto, a retired builder, says nothing but nice things of
Lady Baltwin, as he calls her. He recounts tales of tea
and games on the sitting porch, though if pressed, he
lets slip  that she often cheats at games and sometimes
had some shady characters coming to whisper in her ear
and palm her small bags of what might have been money
before slinking away. "Otherwise a fine lady, indeed." he
quickly adds.
2b. Auntie Baltwin's Home
for Recovery (CR 1)
Nearly swarming with cats and children, this fine upper-class
home appears to be clean and in good condition considering
the number and ages of its inhabitants. Three young boys
shoot marbles in the dirt near the side porch, and inside
strewn toys and more cats lie about on the floors. A few
children take care of chores, while coughs and sneezes softly
erupt from the children's dormitories upstairs.
Auntie Baltwin's Home for Recovery is known for being
a place where sick kids go to get better, and the results
seem amazing. Some people claim the place looks odd
because people are always coming and going, sometimes
taking kids with them. Auntie Baltwin has always played
that off as their parents taking them home. A few of the
kids come and go throughout the day, especially children
that are now well, but have nowhere else to go.  
Zadrian wants the PCs to find out if his donation is going
to be a genuine benefit to the community, and frankly,
it is not. Auntie Gilga Baltwin is a corrupt old crone. In
addition to her abrasive attitude, the woman has three
significant negative qualities the PCs can discover and
report to Ollysta Zadrian (see Development below).
Creatures: A keen old hag of a woman, Auntie Baltwin
is neither caring nor compassionate. She keeps the kids
in her orphanage and treats them for their illnesses,
but she only does so for ancillary reasons. She hopes
to earn a good chunk of coin by keeping the donated
medicines and selling them on the black market, using
her personal talents in healing to treat the children.
Some of kids aren't even orphans and are sent to recover
under her care by wealthy merchants in the district.
She sets a price according to what the family can pay,
often inflating the price by 300% between favored and
disliked families.
The oldest of nine siblings, Gilga Baltwin grew up
taking care of children, first her brothers and sisters, then
her own. Once her children grew up and moved out of the
house, she began taking in orphans--and donations from
local churches and charities. Her talents for care became
well known, and parents throughout the city sent their sick
children to Gilga for healing. She uses skills and magical
talents taught by her own grandmother, and her spells
center around controlling and healing her charges.
Auntie Baltwin uses Sense Motive to determine the
PCs intentions when they arrive at her house. Once she
understands the situation, she begins making outright
lies in an effort to send the PCs away with a positive view of
her operation. If she finds she's failing in this and knows
what they want to hear, she tries and steer them in that
direction. If the PCs begin putting the pieces together or
become overly aggressive, she admits to the transgression
she thinks will be least penalized by the group--likely
her drinking habit. She turns herself in for the smallest
crime the PCs will accept, even if it means she has to
change up her operation. Anything is better than being
arrested at her age. If she notices a PC is wounded when

blending in with the dozen other cats in the room.
Morale Auntie Gilga has no interest in dying and tries to
escape using her potion of invisibility if the PCs become too
violent. She immediately surrenders if reduced to fewer
than half her hit points. Even after giving up, she still
claims the PCs "started the whole thing."

Development: As the PCs interact with Auntie Baltwin,
they may uncover several bits of evidence that implicate
her in illegal or immoral activity--just the sort of evidence
Ollysta Zadrian asked them to discover. Below are Gilga
Baltwin's secrets and the methods by which the PCs can
uncover them.
Alcoholism: Auntie Baltwin is a lifelong alcoholic, and
is frequently drunk or drinking while taking care of the
children. She seems mostly sober when the PCs visit, but as
with all longtime addicts, she exhibits cues to her condition
that are obvious to a keen observer. Any PC making a DC 12
Heal check can spot broken blood vessels in the eyes and
nose, shaky hands, glassy eyes, and a fine sheen of sweat
on the woman. Also, in her sitting room is a nearly empty
bottle of whiskey, as well as a half bottle in the kitchen. If
the woman invites the PCs in for tea, she tips a few splashes
of alcohol in her cup before asking the group if they would
like a taste. If questioned about drinking and taking care of
children, she shoots the PCs an incredulous look and laughs.
"Ha! Seems most days you need it if you want to make it
through the day in this house. These children are killing
me!" Knowing this is the least of her sins, Auntie Baltwin
fesses up to drinking excessively and offers herself up to
guidance and recovery just to get the PCs off her back.
Black Market: Gilga Baltwin also sells expensive
donations from charities on the black market. She has
a fair skill at healing and uses her daily spells to heal
injuries and illnesses in her charges. Sometimes she
they first arrive, she offers to heal him, hoping her feigned
benevolence will throw the PCs off course.
The old woman acts differently toward PCs of
different races and occupations. She acts snide toward
elves, disapproving toward dwarves, suspicious
toward half-orcs, and treats gnomes and
halflings as if they were children, talking to
them simply and even scolding them for dumb
questions or other minor mishaps. Auntie
Baltwin shows the most respect to obvious
casters, perhaps even with a hint of fear.
She stands up to bully fighters, as if daring
them to hit an old lady. The more roguish
members of a party she treats suspiciously,
but otherwise seems to get on with them,
leading their questions and testing their
allegiances. Auntie Baltwin treats he
nature-oriented classes as if they
were hobos, constantly chiding them
for "touching things with their dirty
hands" or asking, "Did you wipe your
feet before coming in?"

to negotiate this encounter, hoping to avoid detection,
arrest, or violence.
During Combat If pushed to fight, Auntie Baltwin uses
her spells to incapacitate the PCs, starting with sleep.
She uses command on any PC trying to attack or grab
her. Otherwise, she screams for help while whacking the
aggressive PCs with her cane or throwing a shoe at them,
in hopes of stalling long enough for the district guard to
come investigate. She can also have Pickles, her cat familiar,

actually uses the medicines and potions sent from places
like the Silver Crusade, especially when it comes to fast
and fatal diseases. Otherwise, she relies on home
remedies, long bed rest, and careful
watch over time. Most of the
donations given to her for the
children end up sold throughout
the city to individuals who, for
whatever reason, can't go to
legitimate sources of healing when
injured or ill. Auntie Baltwin uses
a fence for this side business, and
doesn't sell anything directly out of
her home. A thorough search of her house
(Perception DC 20) reveals stashed
curatives from three different
charities. Auntie Baltwin does not
consent to the search and becomes
increasingly irritated if the PCs snoop
around without her permission.
Child Labor: As her house filled with
children left by their parents, Auntie Baltwin put
them to work as servants and maids in other houses in
the city, especially in the middle-class Eastgate district
where she makes her home. She tells the children their
work pays for their room and board, but the rates she
charges for her pint-sized laborers easily pays for their
lodging while she pockets the rest. The only way to
determine this is to interview the children. Most reports
claim she is mean, but that the children love her cooking
and she tells fun stories at bedtime. Even the children
who work don't call it that, and seem happy to keep busy
and help out. A PC must make a DC 20 Diplomacy check
with two different children out of earshot of Auntie
Baltwin--who interrupts and shoos the children away
if she overhears the PCs asking pointed questions--to
discover the forced labor.
Rewards: If the PCs deliver the medicine and report
any information about Auntie Gilga Baltwin to Ollysta
Zadrian, give each PC 68 gp.
Act 3: Treasures Of Osirion
Among the tasks on the PCs' list is visiting an Osirian
nobleman named Dremdhet Salhar in the Wise Quarter
to get permission for the Pathfinder Society to explore
the Salhar ancestral vaults below Sothis. Salhar serves as
a member of Absalom's Grand Council and is often out
of the house on matters of business, but his aged advisor,
Amenopheus, operates the Osirion faction of Pathfinder
agents from his master's home when not putting
suggestions in the malleable nobleman's ear.
3a. The Salhar Estate
The PCs make their way to the rich estate of Grand
Councilmember Dremdhet Salhar, and are greeted by
a guard who is expecting them as they reach the
tall, wrought-iron gate. Once the PCs are
inside, a servant tells the group Salhar is not
present, called away on important Council
business, but his most trusted advisor
is available to negotiate any business
they may require. The servant explains
this while leading the group down well-
decorated hallways, past expansive rooms.
After a few minutes, the group arrives at
a simple study near the end of a long hallway.
Inside Amenopheus, the Sapphire Sage (N
old male wizard 13), a tan-skinned old
man sits behind a desk flipping through
pages in a large tome. Scraps of paper
jut from the book marking over two
dozen different places. As the group
approaches the open door, the wise sage silently
gestures the PCs into the study with one thin hand,
while closing the tome with the other after finishing
what he was reading. Once the PCs are all inside the
study, he addresses the group.
"Good day to you, Pathfinders. I am Amenopheus, the Sapphire
Sage, advisor to Master Salhar. I understand you were sent
here to discuss archaeological permissions. Knowing this was
coming, I spoke with Master Salhar at length on the subject
and have this to say.
"Since Osirion was reopened to exploration a decade ago,
adventurers, historians, and treasure-seekers flock to my
country by the hundreds, perhaps thousands. While most
families with ancestral burial vaults maintain guards and keep
their sites out of the hands of casual thieves, not all families
have the wealth or power to restrict everyone, and as we all
know, not every defense is perfectly secure. Unscrupulous
tomb robbers and maligned merchant organizations cause
Osirion to bleed relics into the Inner Sea--something the
descendents of Ancient Osirion cannot afford. We Osiriani
have thousands of years of rich history coursing through our
veins, and while that power has been out of focus in recent
years, we are content to wait, knowing our enemies will wear
themselves down. As they fall into arrogance, folly, or greed,
we wait for our return to power, knowing we bear the riches of
our ancestors at our feet.
"Master Salhar remains impressed by the Pathfinder
Society, orating in their favor a handful of times in front
of Absalom's Grand Council, in fact. Due to previous
relationships between him and the Society, Master Salhar
has agreed to grant permission to the Pathfinder Society to
explore his family's vaults below Sothis. The only thing he

Puzzling Props
While you don't need a map for this encounter, it might
help the players' visualize the puzzle better if you draw out
three squares representing the chests, a smaller square
representing the silk box, and a circle representing the
wicker basket. To represent the four keys in the various
containers, you could use coins, dice, or even real keys.
Some sets of GameMastery Item Cards contain cards for
boxes, chests, and keys, and may assist in visualization of this
puzzle. Simply select three chests, one box, a jar, and four
keys from the deck. Feel free to change the descriptions of
the keys and containers to match the item cards used.
First Steps Part I: In Service to Lore

Trap: A writhing, angry green viper rests at the bottom
of the basket hidden among the wadded cloth on which
the rune-etched key sits. Any creature reaching into the
basket provokes it to attack. While the PCs can't disable
the viper, they can bypass the trap by using a tool, mage
hand, or gravity to get the key out of the basket. If they tip
the basket's contents onto the ground, the viper attacks
the nearest creature (use the viper familiar stats on page
133 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary).

Treasure: The runes on this key match those
surrounding the keyhole of the red lacquered chest. The
key radiates a faint aura of transmutation. When this key
is placed within the keyhole of the red lacquered chest,
the chest opens without the key needing to be turned.
The Glass Jar (CR 1/2)
This gallon-sized clear glass jar is about half full with
clear liquid. At the bottom of the vessel sits a jeweled
brass key.
Trap: While the liquid in this jar appears to be water,
it's actually a mildly corrosive cleaning agent. Any creature
reaching into the jar to retrieve the key takes acid damage as
outlined below. If the PCs pour out the jar's contents or break
the jar to free the key from the bottom of the acid, everyone
within 5 feet of the jar takes 1 point of acid damage.

requires is that you retrieve the map of the vaults from his
own vault here. The servant will lead you to the basement
and show you the room."
The Sapphire Sage's eyes twinkle as he smirks knowingly,
then he turns back to reading his book as though he had
never been disturbed.
After leaving Amenopheus' study, the servant brings
the group back through the spacious estate, leading them
down sturdy stone steps into the cool basement. Down a
hallway, after a couple turns, the party ends up at a plain
wooden door. The servant opens the door, gesturing
to the room with a bow, and waits silently for the PCs
to enter. He doesn't know anything beyond that he is
supposed to escort the PCs to this room and lock the door
behind them; if questioned, he remains silent and stoic,
simply waiting for them to go into the vault.
3b. Salhar's Vault (CR 2)
A plain stone room contains three chests: a copper-banded
chest of smooth, dark wood; a red lacquered chest; and what
looks to be a cube of solid steel. Behind the chests sits a low
table holding a clear glass jar half full of liquid and a covered
wicker basket.
Once all of the PCs enter the room, the servant shuts
the door and locks it behind them. Written on the back
of the door is the message: "Within these cases lies your
quest and your way out." These five containers hold clues
to solving the puzzle of this room and one holds the prize
the Pathfinders seek--the map to the Salhar ancestral
vaults beneath Sothis. Amenopheus, ever in search of
new agents within the Pathfinder Society to help forward
Osirion's goals, set this elaborate puzzle to test the PCs'
mettle and cunning. The novice Pathfinders must find
the map and the way out of the room within a half-hour,
at which point the servant returns and opens the door
to release them from their prison, assuming they have
failed the task set before them.

Effect 1d6 acid damage (DC 16 Reflex save for half damage)
Treasure: The jeweled key at the bottom of the jar
seems to fit each box's lock. When the key is placed
in the copper-banded chest's keyhole, the PC
using it receives a Will save for interacting
with the illusory chest as normal. When it is
placed in the red lacquered chest's keyhole,
nothing happens and the key keeps spinning
without making any manner of contact with
the mechanism. Placed in the steel chest's
keyhole, the key breaks, falling into dust as
it's twisted in the lock.
The Copper-Banded Chest
This chest is an illusion. When a PC
touches the chest--such as by placing a
key within its keyhole--she gains a free
Will save. Those who make a DC of 12 see
the chest fade into a faint outline as they
realize it to be an illusion. Others must
interact with it to beat the illusion themselves,
though they receive a +4 bonus if they are informed of
the figment's true nature before interacting with it.
The Red Lacquered Chest
This smooth, red lacquered chest looks devious. The
solid metal plate surrounding the gaping keyhole pulses
with glowing amber runes. When this chest is opened,
a complex pulley system rigged from its lid, through
the f loor, and up to the ceiling releases a small, golden
key from a slit in the ceiling, dropping it 6 inches down
from the 15-foot-high ceiling. A PC making a DC 16
Perception check hears a slight click as the mechanism
activates. Allow the PCs to use creative solutions to
retrieve the key; if they get it down, it can be used to
open the steel chest.
Treasure: The red lacquered chest holds a key forged
into the end of a jeweled scepter. Though the jewels and
the scepter appear to be quite exquisite, a DC 15 Appraise
check reveals them to be mere costume gems. Despite
this deception, the key at the end of the scepter opens
the door to the vault, allowing the PCs to exit the room
at their leisure.
The Steel Chest (CR 1/2)
This steel cube has only the faintest crack where its lid
meets the base, and would be completely featureless save
for its narrow keyhole. The gold key hanging from the
ceiling opens this chest.
Trap: The clasp mechanism of this chest is trapped
such that, unless it's disarmed, any creature opening the
chest (even with the gold key) activates it. It is, however,
a harmless trap meant only to mark those PCs unable to
avoid it for Amenopheus's review.
Prank TrapCR 1/2
Type magic; Perception DC 15; Disable Device DC 15
Effects
Trigger touch; Reset automatic
Effect spell effect (prestidigitation, turns skin blue
for 3d20 minutes, Will DC 11 resists); multiple
targets (all creatures within 10 feet)
Treasure: This chest holds the map of the
Salhar burial vaults beneath Sothis and a
wand of knock (CL 3rd, 11 charges).
Development: If the PCs open the
chests and exit the chamber on their
own within a half-hour, the servant
waiting on the other side tells them
they can keep the map and wand,
but asks them to give back any keys
they may have. If, however, the PCs
are stumped by Amenopheus's puzzle, the servant
opens the door to release them regardless of their
success or failure. He expresses his disappointment
and notes that perhaps other Pathfinders will be better
equipped to prove their worth to his master. In either
case, the servant makes a point of noting which PCs (if
any) have had their skin turned blue.
If the PCs try to find Amenopheus after their ordeal,
they are told he has left for the day. Perhaps they should
try back tomorrow.
Rewards: If the PCs retrieve the map of the Salhar
family vaults, give each PC 82 gp.
Act 4:
A Promise Of Dominance
The fourth task on the PCs' list is to retrieve an item
on loan from the Pathfinder Vault. Paracountess Zarta
Dralneen, an influential diplomat from the devil-
worshiping nation of Cheliax, spent some time studying
the box she borrowed, but she has been unsuccessful
in delving its contents. To make matters worse, today
an imp servant struck with mania is in the process of
trashing her bedroom, making retrieval of the box a
difficult task.
4a. Zarta's Study
Arriving at Paracountess Zarta Dralneen's townhouse
in the Ivy District--one of several homes the
noblewoman keeps around Absalom--the PCs come
upon a magnificent gothic structure three stories in

height. The ebon lacquered double doors wrought with
gleaming silver fixtures greet the characters, a prickly
brass cone hanging from a chain serving as the door
chime. Moments after ringing it, a servant in loose
casual attire opens the door, greeting the Pathfinders
as if expected. If questioned, the servant remains quiet,
only responding when pressed, and then with only a few
simple words: "My mistress will answer any questions
you have once we reach her quarters."
Led through well-appointed sitting rooms, ballrooms,
and a grand stairway granting a view of an elaborate
study, the PCs finally arrive on the third floor of the
house, at the door of Zarta's personal study, which lies
beyond her bedroom. Knocking upon the door and
announcing his presence, the servant opens the darkly
stained wooden door.
A large intricate carpet dominates the marble f loor
in this sitting room. A chaise sits along the north
wall and a desk spans the southeast corner, its chair
positioned with its back to the southwest corner of the
room. Three comfortable chairs are positioned around
a small, low circular table. Hidden in the angled
northwest wall is a secret door, discoverable with a
DC 25 Perception check, which leads to Zarta's secret
library, from which she operates many of her most
delicate operations.
Sitting in the chair behind the desk, Paracountess Zarta
Dralneen (LE female human aristocrat 4 / bard 8) regards
the PCs with a wry smile, putting away a few papers before
standing to address the hopeful Pathfinders.
"Aldor, you are dismissed. Close the door behind you and
attend to your other tasks." She then turns her attention to the
group. "It's always so incredibly adorable when I see a fresh-
faced batch of Pathfinders. I mean, look at you scrumptious
little teacakes. I could eat each and every one of you up.
Well, maybe not you." Zarta points. "I assume this isn't a
pleasure visit since most of you are terribly overdressed for
that manner of occasion, so that must mean you are here for
that trinket Valsin has been nagging me about. Seems I can't
get that man around these parts anymore," she gestures,
sliding her hand down her body and widening the gesture
to sweep out and across the room as if her home were a
secondary thought. "On the good side, he always sends me
all the precious new recruits.
"Many think we in Cheliax serve and worship devils, but
that couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, we use the
creatures for their power. They serve us and we sculpt their

power in our own interests. The world must come to terms
with the order of things. People need to know their place and
operate accordingly. It is the only way to make order from this
world. Too many people stretch too far beyond their station,
making waves and eroding the true order."
The "trinket" Ambrus Valsin sent the PCs to retrieve
is a seven-lock iron case. Zarta tells the PCs about the
box and its locks and seals, explaining she was trying to
bypass the protections. She advises not trying to tamper
with the case when bringing it back to the Grand Lodge,
but never admits to what the case contains. She can tell
them the box is magically warded with abjuration magic
intermingled with strong evocation magic, in addition to
the seven masterwork locks. For PCs delving into the box,
a creature must succeed at a DC 40 Disable Device check
for each lock. Every failed attempt to pick one of the seven
locks results in 1 hit point of damage to the creature
attempting the check as pain shoots through its body. It
is unlikely the PCs can manage this skill check, and since
they were advised not to tamper with the case, hopefully
the damage--combined with these other reasons to leave
the case alone and simply do their duty and return it--
will keep the group from being too curious. Zarta claims
to know nothing about the box aside from it having a
connection with devils and Hell.
As the paracountess talks, a cacophony of booms and
crashes sounds from beyond the room's west door. She
sometimes pauses at an extended eruption of these noises
before continuing with the conversation. If asked about
the neighboring ruckus, Zarta explains, "A servant is
greatly misbehaving. You're going to have to deal with
it in order to get the trinket." She goes over to the desk
in her study, opening a drawer and drawing out an
exquisite silver letter opener shaped like a dagger (treat
as a masterwork silver dagger). "You might need this to
get it to submit," she offers with a sly grin.
4b. The Bedroom (CR 2)
Zarta's bedroom is decorated in the colors of Cheliax--
ebon black and crimson red. Silk, rare woods, and
carefully carved marble compose every bit of furniture
in the room. Goose down now litters the room, covering
almost every surface and the silken shreds of the cushions
that contained it lie about like flayed skin . A post on the
massive screened bed is snapped in half, collapsed on the
bed and drawing the screened curtains into a ripped slope
of formerly fine cloth. Vials of perfume and crystal jars of
other cosmetics sit smashed on the marble floor around
the dresser. A prominent fixture in the room, a large "X"
made of stout wood sits along the west wall, complete with
leather shackles and chains. A table sits to its left strewn
with various items intended for pleasure, but outwardly
resembling implements of pain.
This formerly lavish boudoir provides the deviant
Chelish diplomat a place to relax away from the never-
ending intrigue of Absalom's political scene, and
the decorations indicate she does a fair amount of
entertaining here as well. The northeast wall, next to the
bed, hides a secret door (Perception DC 25) that leads to
the paracountess's secret library.
Creature: The imp Kreuvus is enraged and totally out
of control. The creature desperately wants inside the box
and throws it around the room hoping to smash the thing
open. Though dented, the case doesn't look like it will be
opening anytime soon.
Kreuvus does as much as it can to wreck things while
annoying the PCs. Only after the imp is damaged to half
its hit points does it start actively fighting the PCs. In
addition to the silvered cat-o'-nine-tails Zarta gave the
group, a silver-tipped riding crop lies on the table in the
southwest corner, just inside the door. If the PCs already
completed the task for Guaril Karela (see Act 1), they could
use the powder found in the crate to help locate the imp
when it's invisible.
If the group asks the imp why he wants in the box so
badly, Kreuvus claims it holds a dark leather bag and a
silver hook that allows the user to draw imps--subservient
to the user--directly from Hell. He wants to hide the bag
from mortals to protect devils of his kind.
KreuvusCR 2
Imp (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 78)
hp 16
Tactics
Before Combat Rapt with his reckless destruction, Kreuvus
barely notices, or pays attention to, the PCs until they either
attack or address him. Kreuvus already used his daily use of
augury and suggestion, and just 3 days ago used his weekly
use of commune.
During Combat Kreuvus chooses tactics that annoy or
frustrate his enemies more than those that directly harm
them. He tries to keep his distance and relies on his
invisibility spell-like ability. If any PCs get close to him, he
lashes out with his poison sting.
Morale When reduced to 5 or fewer hit points, Kreuvus flees if
any doors are open. Otherwise, the addled imp surrenders
the case, saying, "Yes, you've bested me, but I don't wish
to leave so soon. Take the blasted box, and tell Mistress
Dralneen I deserve what comes my way."
Treasure: If the PCs ask nicely, Zarta allows one of them
to keep the silver letter opener, but only if they agree to
come back and visit her when they have more free time.

Act 5: Jumped! (CR 3)
As the PCs complete the fourth and final task on their
agenda and head back to the Grand Lodge, they must
pass through the Foreign Quarter back to the Society's
headquarters. Along the way, they are funneled into
an ambush set up by the gang of criminals who have
been tracking them throughout the day. To begin this
encounter, read the following aloud.
A throng of people blocks the street ahead. A performance
art group commandeers the street, drawing graffiti to create
a jolly hellscape complete with illusory devils comically
dancing around in circles. A few citizens avoiding the crowd
slip off-street through a nearby alley, the only egress past
the gathering.
Since leaving the Grand Lodge this morning, four
unscrupulous, fledgling adventurers followed the new
Pathfinders throughout the day, shadowing them on
their tasks. The adventurers are simply looking for an
easy payout, knowing Pathfinders often have excellent
gear, good coin, and frequently carry important items
and documents from place to place in town. Weaving
through back allies and busy streets, the gang members
place themselves in front of the PCs, hoping to herd them
into an advantageous position.
Deandre Dulay used a contact in the rebellious art
group known as the Jocund Pranksters to stage an event
in the adventurers' most likely path. While the Jocund
Pranksters create their chalk and illusion spectacle and
jam traffic flow to side alleys, Deandre's gang surrounds
the PCs in the crowd that makes its way around the
obstruction, planning to jump the PCs when they get out
of sight from the crowd. Other people take this shortcut
as well, and the group of thug adventurers blends into
the crowd until throwing the alleyway into a hazy fog by
casting of obscuring mist. Once that happens, the common
citizens flee, leaving the alley clear for both groups to
deal with each other.
Creatures: Deandre Dulay, an ambitious cleric of
Norgorber, has assembled a band of outcasts as her first
fledgling thieving group, hoping to lead a cell of criminals
in the near future. To achieve her aim, her band needs
income, and that's where robbing Pathfinders comes in.
Young and lithe, with red hair hanging in ringlets that
just brush her shoulders, Deandre doesn't immediately
appear as dire a threat as she actually is. She wears a long
skirt, embroidered with silver and black thread and a
high-necked woolen blouse, its stout fabric concealing
her chain shirt.
The team's not-quite-insane arcanist Halli Fosta does
not interpret the world like other people. She approaches
everything with curiosity, passion, and a cruel streak
a fiend would appreciate. Deandre is uncertain how
having a sociopath in her fledgling group will work out,
but isn't afraid to kill the girl if she gets too crazy. Full
golden blonde hair frames Halli's healthy, smiling face,
punctuated with steely blue eyes and thick red lips. Halli
wears a well-made, green silk dress in the most current
fashion with a shimmering black scarf draped across her
shoulders, and fidgets as the moves, a nervous habit she
picked up as a child trying to hide the extra digit on each
of her hands from casual acquaintances.
The anarchist comedian Larkin Waever, a Galtan
refugee, has a scathing wit he focuses on authority figures.
He began working with Deandre for extra money and the

chance to sow a bit of chaos when his political humor
failed to support his lifestyle. With a face you could easily
forget or miss in a crowd--short-cropped light brown
hair, light complexion, and forgettable brown eyes--
Larkin wears rumpled worker's clothing with a
heavy coat over his chain shirt.
Rounding out the team, the halfling
brawler Ledford more than makes up for
his short stature with his uncontrollable
energy and rampaging anger. A former
circus performer and underground fighting
champion, Ledford hopes he can make
enough money through an alliance with
Deandre to retire to his homeland of Cheliax
with a manor and slaves of his own, while
Deandre simply hopes she can redirect his
rage to take out her enemies instead of causing
any collateral damage on the rest of her team.
With his comical handlebar moustache,
Ledford is an easy face to remember, but
when madness fills his eyes, he's a sight
one soon wants to put as far from memory
as possible.
This is the first time this criminal group has pulled a
hit like this, but Deandre and her thugs have planned their
tactics. If any PCs made their Perception or Sense Motive
checks to notice the thugs watching them as they traveled
about the city, they recognize one of their attackers just
before the ambush, realizing that they've seen the thug's
face before. These PCs may act in the surprise round.

using power attack. He maintains his rage for the
following 6 rounds, but stops using Power Attack if his
first two attacks miss a particular PC. If given a choice of
targets, Ledford always chooses the biggest, strongest
PC. Gleeful at finally being paid to fight people, Ledford
shouts out taunts with each blow, followed with a short
laugh. He clearly enjoys combat.
Morale While raging, Ledford fights to the death. If fatigued
at the end of his 6 rounds of rage and reduced to 4 or
fewer hit points, Ledford offers to call the fight a draw.

them a new assignment in the near future to take them

adventure in this scenario's conclusion, insinuating that
Ambrus Valsin knows at least one venture-captain (the
Lantern Lodge's Amara Li) who has a task she'd like the
PCs to perform.
If any of the players at your table are new to the
Pathfinder Society, make sure to help them complete
their Chronicle sheet.
Success Conditions
In order for the PCs to earn their Prestige Point for
completing the adventure, they must have completed at
least three of the four tasks on Ambrus Valsin's list.
Faction Missions
There are no faction-specific missions in this scenario,
as PCs playing through the First Steps series have not
yet chosen factions, so any PC who meets the scenario's
success conditions earns a second Prestige Point for
completing the scenario. When a PC earns her third
Chronicle (after completing A Vision of Betrayal), all
previously earned prestige will be reported to her
chosen faction.
